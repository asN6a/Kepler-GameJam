This game was made on mobile using Godot Mobile in just one week.

It was also made for my first participation in a Game Jam!

## About
Hello, this game was created for issue #53 of the Wild Game Jam! It was my first game created and the first game jam. to participate in the game jam I only used a cell phone with Godot Mobile and Pixel Studio.

Unfortunately I couldn't finish the game because the idea was much bigger than what I had in mind. but Jam was amazing, I learned a lot that I will definitely use in some future projects!

The idea of the game is the following: You are an astronaut who wakes up on a planet called Kepler (which really exists, but not like the one in the game!), you find pillars scattered around the map that give you a type of energy, which you would use in the future to open a gate. soon after, the whole map collapses and the astronaut discovers that everything is a training simulation for NASA.
